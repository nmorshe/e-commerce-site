React project created as part of an online course.

SHOULD NOTE: Unfortunately this project has no deployment so far - currently can only run locally via
using Vite and a watch command on a JSON file.

To run: 

Download Vite and json-server.

In one command prompt window, navigate to the directory containing these files and type: json-server --watch src/db/db.json --port 3001

In a second command window, navigate to this same directory and type: npm run dev
